Job Title: Python Automation Engineer — Custom Browser, Proxies & AI Automation
Remote (Monday–Friday, 7:00 AM – 4:00 PM EST)
Full-Time Contract (Includes Paid 1-Month Trial)

About PRAI.co
PRAI.co is redefining public relations through the power of artificial intelligence. Our proprietary platform, the PRAI Transformer helps brands achieve massive visibility, influence narratives, and dominate digital spaces with precision.

We’re now building the next generation of infrastructure: custom browser environments, self-hosted AI models, and fully autonomous automation systems. If you’re a top-tier Python engineer ready to push the limits of automation and AI, we want to work with you.

Role Summary
We’re looking for a Python Automation Engineer who can go beyond standard scripting, someone with deep systems thinking who can build scalable automation, simulate human behavior in browser environments, and contribute to AI model integration.

This is a hands-on, zero-to-one role for engineers who want ownership, impact, and the opportunity to shape the future of an AI-driven PR and marketing powerhouse.

Key Responsibilities
Refactor and scale automation systems to manage and scale social media engagement.

Build or modify Chromium-based browser frameworks tailored for automation.

Integrate proxy services and manage large-scale IP rotation (self-hosted or platform-based).

Simulate complex user behavior (mouse movements, keystrokes, scrolling, timing).

Reverse-engineer and analyze platform protections (e.g., fingerprinting, bot detection, captchas).

Deploy and fine-tune small-scale AI models for tasks like content generation, scheduling, personalization.

Maintain automation logic to adapt to platform changes (API, front-end code updates).

Connect systems to Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and message queues for distributed orchestration.

Monitor performance and debug using logs and metrics.

Required Skills
3+ years of Python development with strong automation, system design, and refactoring expertise.

Deep experience with Selenium, Playwright, Puppeteer, or Chrome DevTools Protocol.

Experience modifying or building Chromium-based browsers (via CEF, Electron, Puppeteer Core).

Advanced knowledge of anti-detection tactics: fingerprint, navigator overrides, canvas/WebGL tricks.

Proficient with proxy platforms (e.g., Luminati, Oxylabs, Smartproxy) or custom proxy setups.

Comfortable with async programming, multithreading, and performance tuning.

Familiarity with AI/ML libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, OpenAI, or Langchain.

Ability to fine-tune and deploy local AI models for text generation, classification, or behavioral logic.

Strong experience working with dynamic HTML/CSS/JavaScript environments.

Git proficiency and clear documentation habits.

Intermediate or higher level of English for technical communication.

Bonus Skills
Experience training models or working with vector stores (FAISS, Pinecone).

Knowledge of reinforcement learning for task automation or optimization.

Familiarity with stealth plugins and techniques (undetected-chromedriver, puppeteer-extra).

Understanding of containerization and orchestration (Docker, Celery, Kafka, RabbitMQ).

What We Offer
Remote-first culture aligned to EST working hours.

One-month paid trial followed by performance-based compensation increase.

The product you’ll be responsible for is designed to meet global demand and will be used by clients around the world.

Exposure to cutting-edge technology at the intersection of AI, automation, and influence.

A fast-moving environment where your ideas directly shape the product.
